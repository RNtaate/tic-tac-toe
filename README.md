## How to play tic-tac-toe
1. When the game is opened, it shows all of the instructions and asks you if you want to continue, you are supposed to enter `y` if you want to continue, otherwise enter any other key to terminate the game.
1. When you select to continue, the game will ask you names for `Player 1` and `Player 2`.
1. After that it will start to show any player turn using the names you have just entered
1. The very first player, will be assigned `X` as their mark which will be displayed on the board in accordance with the position they played / selected
1. The second player, will be assigned `O` as their mark which will be displayed on the board in accordance with the position they played / selected
1. The board is made of nine positions which are numbered, if you enter a number, the number of that position will be replaced with your mark, and it won't be available for being played until `game win` or `game draw`
1. When your mark is aligned horizontally, or vertically, or diagonally, that will be a `game win`
1. When all of the positions have been played, without a `game win`, that will be a `game draw`
1. At the end of every `game win` or `game draw`, the game will ask if you want to play another round, you are supposed to enter `y` if you want to continue, otherwise enter any other key to terminate the game.
